This code models a simple banking system with three classes: `Account`, `Customer`, and `Transaction`. 
The `Account` class manages the balance, allowing deposits, withdrawals, and balance display. 
The `Customer` class links a customer to an account and shows their details. 
The `Transaction` class processes deposit and withdrawal actions, updating the account balance. 
The program creates an account, associates it with a customer, and performs a deposit and withdrawal, updating the balance accordingly. 
This structure encapsulates basic banking operations in a modular way.
